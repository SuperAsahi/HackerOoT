"What are you still doing here? Everyone else has left already. You should leave, too."

	"...So you're still here, I see. Listen, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I used to work here. I really don't like this place. Even the locals talk about some scary stories. Perhaps you've heard? One is a scary story that parents tell their children about a creature called The Taker whom takes them into the woods, never to return. I dunno if it's true, but there definitely are some strange things going on here...rumors of people disappearing, then seeing them in the forest later, but their faces aren't really their faces...
	...
	Let me give you something.
	I don't even know why I still have it. What you choose to do with this is up to you. If I were you, I would throw it far away and forget everything I just told you. Either way, I don't want it anymore, so please take it."
	
	
	if (GET_INFTABLE(INFTABLE_))
	"What you choose to do with that key is up to you. Choose wisely."

"A long held belief around the Masca Festival is that there is a creature around here called 'The Taker'. Many believe it's just a superstition, however we can now confirm that it definitely exists. As far as what exactly 'it' is will require much more research..."

Checkable spot 2
"'Masca' - Latin
Meaning spectre, nightmare, mask. (It would appear the original meaning held the idea of concealing one's face to protect from a certain monster."

Checkable spot 3
"The Taker has been around for a lot longer than anyone here realizes. Stories around it go back 100s of years. It would seem that it originally was 



We're not entirely sure where it came from, but it would seem to not be of Earth..."
