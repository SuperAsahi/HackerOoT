"What are you still doing here? Everyone else has left already. You should leave, too."
	if (GET_INFTABLE(INFTABLE_10D))
	"...So you're still here, I see. Listen, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I used to work here. I really don't like this place. Even the locals talk about some scary stories. Perhaps you've heard? One is a scary story that parents tell their children about a creature called The Taker whom takes them into the woods, never to return. I dunno if it's true, but there definitely are some strange things going on here...rumors of people disappearing, then seeing them in the forest later, but their faces aren't really their faces...
	...
	Let me give you something.
	I don't even know why I still have it. What you choose to do with this is up to you. If I were you, I would throw it far away and forget everything I just told you. Either way, I don't want it anymore, so please take it."
	
	
	if (GET_INFTABLE(INFTABLE_))
	"What you choose to do with that key is up to you. Choose wisely."

"Hello kid! If you've had enough fun at the festival, you can walk right through here to head back home. Hope we'll see you next year, too!"

"Have you seen my son? I can't find him anywhere! I told him not to go into the forest!"

"A long held belief connected to the Masca Festival is that there is a creature around here called 'The Taker'. Many believe it's just a superstition, however we can now confirm that it definitely exists. As far as what exactly 'it' is will require more research..."

"'Masca' - Latin
Meaning spectre, nightmare, mask. (It would appear the original meaning held the idea of concealing one's face to protect from a monster.)"

"The Taker has been around for a lot longer than anyone here realizes. Stories around it go back 100s of years. We're not entirely sure where it came from, but it would seem to not be of Earth..."

"Opened up on the screen are some research notes:
'...the object had reappeared on the Princetonâ€™s Aegis SPY 1 radar at our CAP point. This...was far superior in performance to my brand-new F/A-18F and did not operate with any of the known aerodynamic principles that we expect...'"

"The Taker had a different name originally. It was called the 'Face Stealer'. Our research indicates that the creature takes the face of those it comes in contact with, and keeps the original host in its 'den', gradually drawing energy from them, until the host itself becomes a macabre creature, desperately trying to get it's face back from anyone they happen upon. We've captured some of these 'hosts', and are hoping to study them to learn more about the Face Stealer. Our superiors say that the ends justifies the means. Whatever this alien creature is, we must do whatever we can to contain it. Before it's too late..."

"...Is anyone still here? To anyone reading this, GET OUT IMMEDIATELY!! Most of our research assistants have become creatures themselves. The Face Stealer is too powerful. I keep calling the emergency line, but no one is answering. I hear a noise...please, if anyone is there, come help me befo"
